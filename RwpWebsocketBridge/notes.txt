Finalization minimum:
- Port to be a package on skaarOS
    - Panel socket connections for skaarOS?

Next steps:
- Evaluation by endusers
- Mention in Raw Panel documentation (ASCII JSON only)

- Adding support for TCP client connections? (backwards compatibility, local networks)

- Implement processors midway?
- Modity the features object because looking at it from the Websocket server, Binary is not available and only JSON is possible?
- Offer Binary mode?
